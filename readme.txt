SFO\SFX also can be created using a command-line and XML file:
SFOEditor [-c] <inputfile.xml> [-sfo] or [-sfx] or <outputfile>
The [-c] command, which is used to create a new sfo\sfx file.
The <inputfile.xml> which is a template file that contains params.
The <outputfile> can ends with .sfo or .sfx, if you don't want to specify the output file,
then use either [-sfo] or [-sfx] command to save the output file as the same name\location of the xml file.

Advanced:
There is a file named SFOEditor.db, which has the same name as the GUI tool,
